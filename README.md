# apimonitor

## Introduction

The project here is to enhance the original version of the apimonitor (link [here](https://code.google.com/p/droidbox/wiki/APIMonitor)), so we have done few improvement

* Update the androidlib to API 21
* Update the api list to support some more key API
* The output format has changed to JSON, which will be easier to parse
* Change the output name of the apk file

## Usage

Please use python 2.7 version to execute the script

```
$ python2.7 apimonitor.py <apkfile>
```

or

```
$ apimonitor.py <apkfile>
```
